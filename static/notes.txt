get():

The get() method retrieves a single snapshot of the document from the Firestore database.
It fetches the entire document data at once and returns it as a snapshot.
This method is suitable when you want to retrieve the document data for a specific document and you only need to access it once.
stream():

The stream() method returns an iterator that yields multiple snapshots of documents based on the query.
It doesn't retrieve all documents at once, instead, it retrieves documents asynchronously as they become available.
This method is useful when you need to listen for changes to documents in real-time, such as when you're listening for updates, additions, or deletions to documents that match certain criteria.
